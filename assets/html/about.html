            <p>
                Hello, I'm Naufal Rafi, a former Network Engineer that want to start a new journey to the dynamic realm of programming.<br>
                <br>
                My professional journey began with a strong foundation in network engineering. I embarked on a career dedicated to designing, optimizing, and securing digital communication infrastructures. Over the years, I had the privilege of working with diverse teams and tackling complex networking challenges that shaped my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.<br>
                <br>
                However, my passion for technology didn't stop at networks. I found myself drawn to the endless possibilities that programming offers in terms of automation, innovation, and creative problem-solving. To pivot my career and dive deeper into programming, I made a significant decision: I start to became self taught programmer then enrolled in Scholarship Collaboration of <a href="https://www.ycabfoundation.org/"><b>YCAB</b> </a>&<a href="https://skilvul.com/"> <b>Skillvul</b></a> for an intensive coding bootcamp.<br>
                <br>
                The bootcamp experience was transformative. It accelerated my learning and provided hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. I embraced programming languages, library, framework, and Database for becoming Full Stack Web Development like <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MYSQL</b>. The bootcamp not only honed my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to continuous learning.<br>
                <br>
                Now, armed with both a strong educational background in network engineering and practical programming skills, I am pursuing a career that combines the best of both worlds. I believe that my unique perspective as a network engineer turned programmer allows me to approach challenges with a holistic mindset, where infrastructure and applications harmonize seamlessly.<br>
                <br>
                I am eager to contribute my technical expertise to innovative projects, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and continue pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. My journey is ongoing, and I'm excited about the endless opportunities that programming offers for growth, creativity, and impact.<br>
                <br>
